  <p>Welcome to this mini-site dedicated to Web Components. Here you will find several learning resources aimed at getting you up to speed with the latest developments around Web Components.</p>
  <p>There are 18 <a href="/lessons/00.html">Lessons</a> designed to take you from knowing nothing about Web Components to undestanding how they work and how to use them in projects. Each lesson introduces one new concept, and includes example code and a working sample page where you can see the code in action. After completing the lessons, you should have a good understanding of how Web Component technology works, and be able to apply these techniques in your own projects.</p>
  <p>You will also find separate articles that highlight important topics, including deployment instructions, practical patterns, and other tips that will help you tackle the most common issues.</p>
  <p>As you may have noticed, it is mostly a work in progress. Want to contribute? Contact me directly (contact information is in the sidebar) or visit the project's <a href="https://github.com/ruphin/web-component-course">github page</a>.</p>
