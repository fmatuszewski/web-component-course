# Web Component Course and accompanying presentation

## Course

This project contains a little course on the WebComponent v1 specification.

In the 'course' directory you will find 18 HTML files, each with a small lesson introducing a new concept. The lessons come in the form of comments and other explanatory texts in the source code. Simply open the files in a v1 compliant browser (Chrome or Opera) to see the results.

If you have any comments or suggestions regarding the contents of the course, please create an issue on this repository, or send me a message directly.

## Presentation

The project also contains a small presentation on the subject. You can run the presentation with `make` (or `make docker` if you have docker), or `npm install && npm start`
